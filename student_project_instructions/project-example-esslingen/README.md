# Analysis of Traffic Light System in Esslingen

## Scenarios
We invesitgate three scenarios

- Scenario 1: Current situation ("bad" traffic light system, 30kmh speed limit)
- Scenario 2: No traffic light system
- Scenario 3: No traffic light system & Speed Limit 50kmh everywhere


## Methods
To calculate MFD (macroscopic fundamental diagram) we place lots of sensors (E1, Inductive Loop Sensors) on every edge at least one.
